# Burger
Eat the Burger! uses persistent data (MySQL and unique ORM) and a template engine (Handlebars) to generate the HTML. It's a full stack app using node and express for the server, deployment on Heroku, MySQL, node, and Express for the back-end, and vanilla JS and CSS and Handlebars for the front-end. It follows a MVC (model view controller) design.

## Instructions
1. Create a new burger by typing in the name.
2. Eat or make burgers by clicking their respective green buttons.
3. Delete a burger from the app and database by clicking the yellow buttons.
4. Know there's tons of work going on behind the scenes of this seemingly simple app.
